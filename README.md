# Crossy Road Project for Intro to Game Design



This project aims to bring the essence of Crossy Road to life within the Unreal Engine. While it is a simplified version compared to the original game, it still captures the core gameplay mechanics and charm. Players will navigate their character through a challenging environment, crossing roads and rivers while avoiding obstacles and collecting valuable coins. With its focus on simplicity and enjoyment, this implementation offers a fun experience inspired by the beloved Crossy Road.
